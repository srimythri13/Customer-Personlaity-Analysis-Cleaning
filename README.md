Customer Personality Analysis – Data Cleaning (Excel)  In this task, I worked on cleaning the Customer Personality Analysis dataset using Microsoft Excel. The raw data initially had issues such as:Merged data in a single column  Improper or missing headers  Duplicate rows  Null or missing values  Inconsistent data formats   Actions Performed:
1. Separated merged data using Excel’s Text to Columns feature.
2. Renamed and corrected column headers for clarity and accuracy.
3.Removed duplicate entries using the Remove Duplicates function.
4. Identified and highlighted missing values via Conditional Formatting
5. Checked data types and reformatted them as needed.
